# Heroic Armory Legacy  

## ... decompiled.  
This repository holds the decompiled code of the mod [Heroic Armory Legacy](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/heroic-armory-legacy).  
Gradle is configured, and errors and most warnings are fixed. Just use it as a regular open-source mod, it can even recompile.  
Code here is based on version 1.5 (for MC 1.16.5). I chose it because it has the highest version number. ;)  

## but why?  
1. Check their CurseForge page. They marked it as MIT-licensed (when I saw it on 2024-02-16), but I can't find its source code on GitHub.  
2. It is last updated on 2023-03-20 (as CurseForge page says), and pictures on its CurseForge page have even become all invalid. This project is not active, so I'm doing something for possible porters.  
3. Just because I can do it NGAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH  

## TODO  
- Maybe I'll somehow rewrite it so that no one can blame.  
- Convert it to Kotlin so that no one need to care about its targeting java 17.
